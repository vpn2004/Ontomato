 * Late fact: a fact that becomes ready only after the execution facts have been finalized; the quality check is currently the only one.

 * The execution that produces it neither pushes it itself nor starts an unowned background read; it hands the pending item back to the caller.
 * The caller registers it with the current run, so the run owns its cancellation and settlement. Whether the run waits for settlement
 * before finalizing depends on whether the run's presentation includes it — the standard query turn display has a quality-check panel so it waits,
 * while deep analysis workflows, reports, and run presentation never consume the quality check so they do not wait; it is only written back for later review.
